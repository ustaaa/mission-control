# Mission Control PWA - Mobile Deployment Guide

## 📱 What's a PWA?
A Progressive Web App (PWA) lets Mission Control work like a native app:
- Add to home screen with custom icon
- Works offline (cached data)
- Full-screen experience (no browser chrome)
- Fast loading via service worker caching

---

## 🤖 Android - Add to Home Screen

### Chrome (Recommended)
1. Open Mission Control in Chrome
2. Tap **⋮** (three dots menu) in top-right
3. Tap **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install app"**
4. Customize name if desired → Tap **Add**
5. Icon appears on home screen 🎛️

### Samsung Internet
1. Open Mission Control
2. Tap **☰** menu → **"Add page to"** → **"Home screen"**

### Firefox
1. Open Mission Control  
2. Tap **⋮** menu → **"Install"**

## 🍎 iOS - Add to Home Screen

### Safari (Required - Chrome/Firefox don't support iOS PWA)
1. Open Mission Control in **Safari**
2. Tap the **Share button** (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Edit name if desired → Tap **Add**
5. App icon appears on home screen 🎛️

### iOS Notes
- iOS requires Safari for PWA installation
- Standalone mode hides Safari UI completely
- Data persists between sessions
- Push notifications not fully supported on iOS yet

## 💻 Desktop - Install as App

### Chrome

2. Click **⋮** menu → **"Install Mission Control..."**
   - Or click the install icon in the address bar
3. App opens in its own window

## 🔮 Future: Native App Wrapping

For app store distribution, consider:

### Android - TWA (Trusted Web Activity)
```bash
# Using Bubblewrap CLI
npx @anthropic-ai/anthropic-sdk -g @nicknisi/bubble-wrap
bubblewrap init --manifest https://your-domain.com/manifest.json
bubblewrap build
# Outputs APK for Google Play
```

### iOS/Android - Capacitor
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init "Mission Control" com.moltbot.missioncontrol
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
npx cap sync
# Opens in Xcode/Android Studio
```

### Considerations
- Native wrappers add ~2-5MB overhead
- App store review process required
- Updates require new builds (not instant like PWA)
- PWA is sufficient for most use cases

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" not appearing?
- Must be served over HTTPS (or localhost)
- Manifest must be valid JSON
- Service worker must be registered

### Offline not working?
- Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Clear cache and reload: `navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(r => r.forEach(sw => sw.unregister()))`

### iOS icon not showing?
- iOS requires `apple-touch-icon` link tag
- SVG icons may not render; consider PNG fallback
